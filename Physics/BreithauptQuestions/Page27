1. The following reaction was observed when two protons collided head-on at high speed:
  A.I. Show that the charge is conseverd in this reaction

	Charge of Proton = 1
	Charge of Neutron = 0
	Charge of pi+ = 1

	1 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1

	2 = 2

	Charge is the same on both sides (+2)

    II. What other quantity is conserved in this reaction?
	
	Baryon number

  B. Use the rest energy values to show that the two protons an
