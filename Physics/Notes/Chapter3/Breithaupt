1.A. How does the quark composition of a meson compare with the quark composition of a baryon.

	A quark is made of a quark-antiquark pair, whereas a baryon has three quarks or three antiquarks

  B. State the composition of:
    I. Proton
	
	uud

    II. Neutron

	udd

2. Determine the quark composition of each of the following hadrons, given its strangeness.
  A. A pi0 meson (S = 0)

	uU

  B. An Antiproton (S = 0)

	UUD

  C. A K minus meson (S = -1)

	sU

  D. A Sigma0 baryon (S = -1)

	sud

3. In Beta plus decay, a positron and an electron neutrino are emitted when a proton in the nucleus changes into a neutron.
  A. In terms of quarks, draw a Feynman diagram to represent this change.

  B. Describe the changes that are represented in this diagram.

	An up quark turns into a down quark and a virtual W boson is exchanged with the beta plus particle and electron neutrino, both of which are released.

4.A. A Sigma minus particle has a strangeness of -1. Show that it is composed of a strange quark and two down quarks.

	Strangeness: -1 + 0 + 0 = -1 
	Charge: -1/3 + -1/3 + -1/3 = -1
	Correct charge and strangness so Sigma minus is sdd

  B. A K+ meson is composed of a strange antiquark and an up quark. A Sigma- baryon is composed of a strange quark and two down quarks. They can be created in the
     reaction shown below.

     Describe this reaction in terms of quark and antiquarks.

	dU + uud = Su + sdd
	One of the up quarks from the proton and the up antiquark annihilate each other, and then pair production occurs to create sS. The down quarks combine with the
	new Strange quark to form the Sigma-, and the remain up quark and strange antiquark form a K+ meson.
