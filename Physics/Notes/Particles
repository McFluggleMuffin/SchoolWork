\subsubsection{Key Words}

	\paragraph{Electron Volt} is the energy of a single electron if it passes through a potential difference of one volt.
	\paragraph{An Ion} is an atom with a different amount of electrons to the standard atom.
	\paragraph{Excitation} is the process by which an electron absorbs a particular quantity of energy to transition to a higher energy state (electron orbital).

\subsubsection{}	

	\paragraph{} The further an atomic electron is away from the nucleas, the more energy it has. If an external electron is involved in a collision with an atomic
	electron, the atomic electron can absorb energy and move away from the nucleas. The exact amount absorbed is removed from the kinetic energy of the external
	electron. The quantities of energy needed to move between energy levels are all exact. 
	\paragraph{} A photon can also cause this excitation, however this is only true if the photon has \textbf{exactly} the right amount of energy. 
	\paragraph{} An atmoic electron can completely leave the atom if it gains enough energy.
