	A scalar quantity is one that has a magnitude, but does not have a direction.	
	A vector quantity has both magnitude, and direction.

\subsubsection{Addition of vectors}

	\paragraph{}Vectors can be added together in order to form a \textbf{resultant} force. For all intents and purposes, the resultant force can be used as the only
	force acting on the object. There are two main ways to resolve and calculate resultant force.
	\paragraph{}The first is trigonometry, using cos and sin to resolve each diagonal force into its vertical and horizontal \textbf{components}. If two forces act
	in the same or opposite directions, they can be added or subtracted respectively. Once all that is left is one horizontal force, and one verticle, pythagoras
	and more tig can be used in order to work of the resultant of the two.
	In order to do this, place the two vector arrows 'tip to tail' and then work of the hypotenous of the triangle created.
	\paragraph{}The second is scale diagrams, which work by deciding on a scale, such as 1 Newton = 1 Centimetre. Each arrow can then be put tip to tail in a line,
	and the	resultant force is the arrow that joins the last tip to the first tail. If the forces create a fully enclosed shape, then the system would be in
	\textbf{equilibrium}.
