\subsection{Forces in equilibrium}

	A scalar quantity is one that has a magnitude, but does not have a direction.	
	A vector quantity has both magnitude, and direction.

\subsubsection{Addition of vectors}

	\paragraph{}Vectors can be added together in order to form a \textbf{resultant} force. For all intents and purposes, the resultant force can be used as the only
	force acting on the object. There are two main ways to resolve and calculate resultant force.
	\paragraph{}The first is trigonometry, using cos and sin to resolve each diagonal force into its vertical and horizontal \textbf{components}. If two forces act
	in the same or opposite directions, they can be added or subtracted respectively. Once all that is left is one horizontal force, and one verticle, pythagoras
	and more tig can be used in order to work of the resultant of the two.
	In order to do this, place the two vector arrows 'tip to tail' and then work of the hypotenous of the triangle created.

\subsubsection{Example Question}
	\paragraph{} Calculate the magnitude of the resultant force on the object, and the angle from which it acts.

\begin{tikzpicture}



\draw (4,4) rectangle (6,6);
\draw[->] (3.5,5) -- (4,5) node[anchor=south east] {1N};
\draw[<-] (7.5,5) -- (6,5) node[anchor=south west] {4N};

\draw[->] (5,3.5) -- (5,4) node[anchor=south west] {4N};

\end{tikzpicture}

	\paragraph{A)}The two horizontal forces can be combined, leaving a resultant force of $3N$ to the left. This, along with the $4N$ vertical force, can be redrawn
	as such.

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1.5,0) node[anchor=south] {3N} -- (3,0);
\draw[->] (3,0) -- (3,2) node[anchor=west] {4N} -- (3,4);
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1.5,2) node[anchor=north east] {X} -- (3,4);

\end{tikzpicture}

	\paragraph{}The value of X can be found with pythagoras' theorem, $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$, and therefore $X = \sqrt{3^{2} + 4^{2}} = 5$
	\paragraph{}The value of $\theta$ can be found using trigonometry, and the fact that $\tan{\theta} = \frac{4}{3}$

	\paragraph{}The second is scale diagrams, which work by deciding on a scale, such as 1 Newton = 1 Centimetre. Each arrow can then be put tip to tail in a line,
	and the	resultant force is the arrow that joins the last tip to the first tail. If the forces create a fully enclosed shape, then the system would be in
	\textbf{equilibrium}. 

\subsubsection{Equilibrium}

	\paragraph{}For a system to be in equilibrium, two conditions must be met. The first is that there is not a resultant force in any direction. The second is that
	there is no resultant moment. "Change to italics" See point 1.2.1 for how to calculate resultant moment.

\subsection{Moments}
\subsubsection{Calculating resultant moment}

	\paragraph{}To calculate a moment, a pivot must be found. Each force acting on the object will attempt to rotate it around this point. To calculate the moment
	of each force, the equation, Moment = Force x Perpendicular Distance to Pivot, must be used.
	\paragraph{}Leverage is the idea that the further away you are from the pivot, the less the force required to turn the object it. The equation above shows this,
	as the greater the distance, the greater the moment. 
	\paragraph{}Moments that turn clockwise can all be added together, and the same goes for any anti-clockwise moments. One can then be subtracted from the other,
	and a resultant moment is given. If this is 0, the object will not spin, if it is more, then the object will.

\subsubsection{Example Question}
	\paragraph{} Assuming the system below is in equilibrium, calculate the distance x.

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[thick] (0,10) node[anchor=east] {\textbf{A}} -- (10,10) node[anchor=west] {\textbf{B}}; %Main Beam

\draw[thick, ->] (1,12) -- (1,10) node[anchor=south west] {3N};
\draw[thick, ->] (8,12) -- (8,10) node[anchor=south east] {5N}; %Forces

\draw[dashed, very thin] (8,10) -- (8,9.5); %Line of action of forces
\draw[dashed, very thin] (1,10) -- (1,9.5); 

\draw [<-] (8,9.5) -- (6.5,9.5) node[anchor=south] {3.0};
\draw[->] (6.5,9.5) -- (5,9.5); %Distance from 4N force to pivot P
\draw[<-] (5,9.5) -- (3,9.5) node[anchor=south] {X}; 
\draw[->] (3,9.5) -- (1,9.5); %Distance from 3N force to pivot P

\draw[thick, ->] (5,8.5) node[anchor=north] {\textbf{P}}-- (5,10); %Pivot

\end{tikzpicture}

	\paragraph{A)} If the above system is in equilibrium, then the total clockwise moment is equal to the total anti-clockwise moment. The total clockwise moment
	equal to $5 * 3$, as this is Force times Perpendicular Distance. This makes the moment $15 Nm^{-1}$
	\paragraph{} The anti-clockwise moment is therefore also $15 Nm^{-1}$, and so we know that $15 = 4 * X$, we simply divide by 4 to get $X = \frac{15}{4}$, or
	$3.75m$
