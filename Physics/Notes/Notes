\subsection{Excitation and Ionisation}

\subsubsection{Key Words}
	\paragraph{Electron Volt} is the energy of a single electron if it passes through a potential difference of one volt.
	\paragraph{An Ion} is an atom with a different amount of electrons to the standard atom.
	\paragraph{Excitation} is the process by which an electron absorbs a particular quantity of energy to transition to a higher energy state (electron orbital).
	\paragraph{Ionisation} is any process by which an atom becomes an ion.

\subsubsection{Excitation}	
	\paragraph{} The further an atomic electron is away from the nucleas, the more energy it has. If an external electron is involved in a collision with an atomic
	electron, the atomic electron can absorb energy and move away from the nucleas. The exact amount absorbed is removed from the kinetic energy of the external
	electron. The quantities of energy needed to move between energy levels are all exact. 
	\paragraph{} A photon can also cause this excitation, however this is only true if the photon has \textbf{exactly} the right amount of energy. 
	\paragraph{} An atmoic electron can completely leave the atom if it gains enough energy. 

\subsubsection{Page 35 Questions}
	\paragaph{1} ionisation is the gain or loss of electrons, in excitation, an electron simply moves between energy levels. In both however, a change in the total
	energy of the atom occurs.
	\paragraph{2a} $10.4 * (1.6 * 10^{-19}) = 1.664 * 10^{-18}J$
	\paragraph{2b} $12 - 10.4 = 1.6eV$
	\paragraph{3a} The ionisation energy of neon is much greater than that of sodium. Therefore, \textbf{less} energy is needed to remove an electron from a sodium
	atom than from a neon atom.
	\paragraph{3b} An electron that causes excitation of an atom by colliding with it has \textbf{more} kinetic energy before the collision than after the
	collision. The atom's internal energy \textbf{increases} and the electron's kinetic energy \textbf{decreases} 
	\paragraph{4a} An atomic electron in the gas atom gains energy and is excited, and so moves up to the next energy level. The external electron loses this amount
	in kinetic energy.
	\paragraph{4b} The external electron does not have enough energy to move an atomic electron to the next energy level, and so none is abosorbed as electrons
	cannot exist between levels.

\subsection{Photon emmision}
\subsubsection{Luminous gases}
	\paragraph{} Gases at low pressure emit light when electrons are passed through the gas (so that it is conducting electricity). The atomic electrons absorb
	energy when a collision occurs and are excited. When they move down energy levels, which can occur at anytime, a photon is emmited.
	\paragraph{} Fluorescent bulbs contain mercury and argon gases, which when excited create invisible ultra violet light. This is then abosorbed by the internal
	coating, the atoms of which are excited and then begin to emmit visible light.

\subsubsection{Photon emmision calculation}
	\paragraph{} When an electron moves down an energy level, a photon is emmitted. The exact energy of photon produced when an electron moves from level 4 to 3 is
	as follows, $E_p = E_4 - E_3$ and therefore the frequency of the photon can be calculted by the equation $E_p = hf$ where $h = 6.63 * 10^{-34}$.

\subsubsection{Page 38 Questions}

	\paragraph{1a} $9eV$
	\paragraph{1b}	
\begin{align*}
	E_p &= E_3 - E_2
	E_p &= E_3 - E_1
	E_p &= E_3 - E_0
	E_p &= (E_3 - E_2) + (E_2 - E_1) + (E_1 - E_0)
	E_p &= (E_3 - E_1) + (E_1 - E_0) 
	E_p &= (E_3 - E_2) + (E_2 - E_0) %Change to diagram to show arrows of changes
\end{align*}
	\paragraph{2a} In excitation, an electron gains energy, but it will lose energy in de-excitation. Also, in excitation, the electron moves further away from the
	nucleus, but closer in de-excitation.	
	\paragraph{2b i}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%Must add diagram
\end{tikzpicture}
	\paragraph{2b ii} 
\begin{align*}
	E_p &= (4.6 - 1.8) * 1.6 * 10^{-19}
            &= 4.48 * 10^{-19}J
	&
	E_p &= (1.8 - 0) * 1.6 * 10^{-19}
	    &= 2.88 * 10^{-19}J
	&
	E_p &= (4.6 - 0) * 1.6 * 10^{-19}
	    &= (7.36 * 10^{-19}J
\end{align*}
	\paragraph{4} When the electricity supply is turned off the atoms in the tube do not collide with any more electrons, as none are flowing. Because of this, no
	excitations occur, and electrons will not be able to move down energy levels. This process is not instantaneous however, as some electrons will move down after
	the power is turned off, however none will be able to move up.

\subsubsection{Stopping potential}
	\paragraph{} Electrons that escape from the metal can be attracted back to it given that the plate has sufficient positive charge. The minimum potential needed
	is called the stopping potential $V_s$. At this potential, the maximum kinetic energy of the emmitted electron is 0, as it must do extra work equal to 
	$e * V_s$. \textit{$e = $the charge on one electron, or $1.6 * 10^{-19}$}

\subsubsection{Spectra question}
	\paragraph{} When a charged particle with enough kinetic energy collides with a gas atom, an exact amount of this energy can be absorbed, and this will cause an
	an atomic electron to excite and move up energy levels. When this electron de-excites, and moves down energy levels, a photon is emitted. This photon has energy
	exactly equal amount the electron loses, and is always the same for the same de-excitation. Because the energy of a photon is equal to its frequency times
	Planck's constant, all the photons emitted have a discrete frequency. These frequencies can be absorbed and represented as sepectral lines, on a graph.

\section{Mechanics and materials}

\subsection{Forces in equilibrium}
	A scalar quantity is one that has a magnitude, but does not have a direction.	
	A vector quantity has both magnitude, and direction.

\subsubsection{Addition of vectors}
	\paragraph{}Vectors can be added together in order to form a \textbf{resultant} force. For all intents and purposes, the resultant force can be used as the only
	force acting on the object. There are two main ways to resolve and calculate resultant force.
	\paragraph{}The first is trigonometry, using cos and sin to resolve each diagonal force into its vertical and horizontal \textbf{components}. If two forces act
	in the same or opposite directions, they can be added or subtracted respectively. Once all that is left is one horizontal force, and one verticle, pythagoras
	and more tig can be used in order to work of the resultant of the two.
	In order to do this, place the two vector arrows 'tip to tail' and then work of the hypotenous of the triangle created.

\subsubsection{Example Question}
	\paragraph{} Calculate the magnitude of the resultant force on the object, and the angle from which it acts.	
	\bigskip \bigskip

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw (4,4) rectangle (6,6);
\draw[->] (3.5,5) -- (4,5) node[anchor=south east] {1N};
\draw[<-] (7.5,5) -- (6,5) node[anchor=south west] {4N};

\draw[->] (5,3.5) -- (5,4) node[anchor=south west] {4N};

\end{tikzpicture}
	\paragraph{A)}The two horizontal forces can be combined, leaving a resultant force of $3N$ to the left. This, along with the $4N$ vertical force, can be redrawn
	as such.

\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1.5,0) node[anchor=south] {3N} -- (3,0);
\draw[->] (3,0) -- (3,2) node[anchor=west] {4N} -- (3,4);
\draw[->] (0,0) -- (1.5,2) node[anchor=north east] {X} -- (3,4);

\end{tikzpicture}
	\paragraph{}The value of X can be found with pythagoras' theorem, $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$, and therefore $X = \sqrt{3^{2} + 4^{2}} = 5$
	\paragraph{}The value of $\theta$ can be found using trigonometry, and the fact that $\tan{\theta} = \frac{4}{3}$
	\paragraph{}The second is scale diagrams, which work by deciding on a scale, such as 1 Newton = 1 Centimetre. Each arrow can then be put tip to tail in a line,
	and the	resultant force is the arrow that joins the last tip to the first tail. If the forces create a fully enclosed shape, then the system would be in
	\textbf{equilibrium}. 

\subsubsection{Equilibrium}
	\paragraph{}For a system to be in equilibrium, two conditions must be met. The first is that there is not a resultant force in any direction. The second is that
	there is no resultant moment. "Change to italics" See point 1.2.1 for how to calculate resultant moment.

\subsection{Moments}
\subsubsection{Calculating resultant moment}
	\paragraph{}To calculate a moment, a pivot must be found. Each force acting on the object will attempt to rotate it around this point. To calculate the moment
	of each force, the equation, Moment = Force x Perpendicular Distance to Pivot, must be used.
	\paragraph{}Leverage is the idea that the further away you are from the pivot, the less the force required to turn the object it. The equation above shows this,
	as the greater the distance, the greater the moment. 
	\paragraph{}Moments that turn clockwise can all be added together, and the same goes for any anti-clockwise moments. One can then be subtracted from the other,
	and a resultant moment is given. If this is 0, the object will not spin, if it is more, then the object will.

\subsubsection{Example Question}
	\paragraph{} Assuming the system below is in equilibrium, calculate the distance x.

\draw[thick, ->] (5,8.5) node[anchor=north] {\textbf{P}}-- (5,10); %Pivot

\end{tikzpicture}
	\paragraph{A)} If the above system is in equilibrium, then the total clockwise moment is equal to the total anti-clockwise moment. The total clockwise moment
	equal to $5 * 3$, as this is Force times Perpendicular Distance. This makes the moment $15 Nm^{-1}$
	\paragraph{} The anti-clockwise moment is therefore also $15 Nm^{-1}$, and so we know that $15 = 4 * X$, we simply divide by 4 to get $X = \frac{15}{4}$, or
	$3.75m$
