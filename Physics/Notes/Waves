Waves

Transverse

For a transverse wave, the direction of particle movement is perpendicular to the direction of wave propogation. 
The amplitude is defined as the distance between the mid point of the wave, to either the top of a crest or the bottom of a trough. It can also be described by the
maximum displacement that a particle experiences from its original position. Amplitude is represented by the letter A.
The wavelength is the distance between the top of two crests, or any two identical points on adjacent oscilations. It is most commonly represented by the greek symbol
lambda. The time period, is the time it takes for one complete wavelength to pass a point, and so in that time both a crest and a trough will be seen.

Longitdinal

In a longitudinal wave, the direction of particle movement is the same as the direction of propogation. Instead of crests and troughs, a longitudinal wave has
compressions and rarefactions. The amplitude of a longitudinal wave is the same as a transverse one, it is the maximum particle displacement from its original
position. The wavelength is again similar, but is most easily measured as the distance between the centre of two rarefactions.
