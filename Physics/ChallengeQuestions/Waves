\section{} A monochromatic point light of wavelength Lamda is shining through two narrow slits separated by a distance d on a screen which is a distance D away (D>>d)
from the slits. Sketch the pattern of light intenisty Observed on the screen. Explain why there are minima and maxima. If lambda corresponds to red light, what would
the pattern look like for green light, add this to the sketch.

\textbf{Diagram 1.1}
\paragraph{} Maxima and minima occur because as the light passes through the slits, it diffracts outwards in a circular pattern. Maxima and minima occur because of a
difference in path difference, the distance from the slit to the point of the screen. Maxima occur at a path difference of a whole number of wavelengths, as the waves
are in phase. Minima occur where the path difference is equal to an odd number of half wavelengths.
