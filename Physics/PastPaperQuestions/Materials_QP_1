1.A.
	Tensile stress - Force per unit cross sectional area
	Tensile stress - Ratio of extension to original length (Extension over length)

  B.I.  
	Between A and B, the wire is undergoing elastic deformation, and is following Hooke's law. Between B and C it is undergoing plastic deformation, and is becoming
	permanently changed. From C to D, the weight is being removed, and the wire is again following Hooke's law and acting elastically. The distance from A to D
	shows that permanent extension has occured, when the wire was acting plastically. 

    II.
	Ductile, as it extends with noticable yield, without snapping.

    III.
	The permanent extension due to plastic deformation.

    IV.
	Young's Modulus is the gradient of either straight section, either A to B, or D to C.

    V. 
	The area under the graph

  C.
	2.1 * 10^11 = (75 * 3) / (Ex * 2.8 * 10^-7)
	2.1 * 10^11 = (225 * 10^7) / (Ex * 2.8)
	5.88 * 10^11 = (225 * 10^7) / Ex
	Ex          = (225 * 10^7) / (5.88 * 10^11)
	Ex          = 225 / (5.88 * 10^4)
	Ex          = 2.25 / (5.88 * 10^2)
	Ex	    = 3.826 * 10^-3
